# Delphi

## How to use
Ongoing list of dependencies, but the current working product is in 'pipeline_OpenAI.py' which requires a few things. 1. You need to have ollama installed and 2. You need to put an OpenAI api key in a .env file. You should expect it to take some time to run, but once it is setup you can type a query and it should do something. I am hoping to work on 'pipeline_xLAM.py' so we don't have to use OpenAI credits, but we will have to figure that out in the future.
