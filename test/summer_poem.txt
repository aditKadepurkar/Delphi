Summer days are long and bright,
With golden sun and skies of blue.
The flowers bloom, a lovely sight,
While gentle breezes kiss the view.

Children laugh and play outside,
Barefoot on the grassy ground.
With every moment, joy and pride,
In nature's warmth, our hearts are found.

Ice cream melts, a sweet delight,
As we gather 'neath the shade.
With friends and family, spirits light,
These memories will never fade.

As twilight falls, the stars appear,
The fireflies dance in the night.
Summer's essence lingers near,
A season filled with pure delight.
